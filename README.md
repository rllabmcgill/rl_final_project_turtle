Turtle Learning Environment (TLE) is a minimalistic connect-the-dots environment made as part of COMP 767 RL Final project in McGill University. The objective of the agent in a 28x28 grid world is to connect the dots provided to form the image, where the environment provides negative reward for each cell drawn and positive reward for each connected components.

## Desired optimal behaviour

Ideally, we would like to visualize this behaviour, which also describes the nuances of our environment.
